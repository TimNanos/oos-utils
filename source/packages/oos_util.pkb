   *  - It is recommended that you use Oracle's lock procedures: http://psoug.org/reference/sleep.html
   *  - However in some instances you may not have access to them

   *  - If calling in SQLDeveloper may get "IO Error: Socket read timed out". This is a JDBC driver setting, not a bug in this code.
